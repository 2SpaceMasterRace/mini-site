          Hi! I'm Hari Varsha, better known as vxsha-256 or nanodijkstra around the internet. From an early age, Iâ€™ve been captivated by computers, spending almost all my free time playing Pokemon MMOs, cracking old-school video games, and perusing through internet forums learning random trivia in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve become deeply entrenched in the world of <b>deep systems programming, AI research, game engine development, and cloud infrastructure</b>. Apart from intense hacking, I like consuming comics like XKCD and SMBC, reading Hacker News and Lobste.rs threads, and especially appreciate essays from cool people like Paul Graham, Jeff Atwood, Joel Spolsky, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I run the <b>Arcane Systems Reading Group</b>, a collective of systems enthusiasts who explore niche topics like compiler internals, distributed systems, low-latency systems, and performance engineering. I am <b>currently applying to graduate programs</b>, and I'm open to <b>MS/PhD programs</b> (unfortunately will be requiring funding), so if you think you'd like an intense & passionate student on your team, please reach out!
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold">Current</h2>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-gray-700 p-4 my-4">
          <p>
            ðŸš¨ I'll be presenting Memspect at the first edition of <strong>Innovations In Compiler Technology (IICT)</strong> in Bangalore, India! ðŸš¨
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 className="font-semibold pt-4">Things I'm getting good at</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Competitive programming</strong>, particularly aiming for International Grandmaster at Codeforces and compete at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Participate in proper Hackathons</strong>, and build some actually cool prototypes. I'd like to try out everything from AI hackathons to programming contests like CTFs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start/Get involved in an entrepreneurial venture</strong> on something I'm deeply passionate about. I'd probably start with video-game infra tech (probably will start my YCombinator/Founder mode arc soon).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="font-semibold pt-4">Ongoing Projects</h2>
        <p>
          My projects reflect my interests in machine learning infrastructure, hardware engineering, game development, and systems-level programming. Here are some projects Iâ€™m currently working on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <b>Memspect</b> [C, Go, LLVM]: A cool static analysis framework for real-world C codebases. Focuses on fast and accurate memory debugging. Gained compiler internals knowledge. Started off as a final-year project and was presented at two conferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ART.tv</b> [Typescript, Go]: Iâ€™ve always loved films, so it only makes sense I build a streaming platform for indie movies. Inspired by Mubi and Twitch, this is my full-stack project where I allow creators to showcase their arthouse and foreign language films and allow me to build a real-world product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Kaze 3DS</b> [Rust, Zig]: Emulators have always been a fascination for me, and since all 3DS emulators struggle to run on low-end PCs, Iâ€™ve decided to build my own blazingly fast 3DS emulator with portability and networked multiplayer in mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cherenkov</b> [Rust, Go]: After participating in Andreas Klingâ€™s Browser Jam, I decided to build a minimal, full-fledged Vim web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Amaterasu</b> [Typescript, C, Go]: Working on my own MMORPG in C and Go as part of the Ooga Booga Game Devs community, where a group of game devs come together to ship great games from scratch in C, while mastering the ancient art of Caveman Programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Loveless</b> [Rust, Zig]: A cool edge database focused on scaling performance to handle massive multiplayer environments. Started building it as part of Summer of Shipping 2024 after being inspired by Tiger Beetle and Turso. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Axogig</b> [Rust, C, C++]: Building a high-performance deep learning accelerator for hackers to train their own neural nets at home without needing to rely on large-scale vendors as part of Buildspaceâ€™s Nights & Weekends Season 5.
            </li>
        </ul>
