          Thanks for visiting my <tt>about_me.md</tt> ! I'm a kernel-grade computer systems engineer and researcher 
          with a strong focus on distributed systems and machine learning systems.
          I'm currently pursuing my master's in computer science at <b>New York University</b> and did my undergrad in electrical
          and computer engineering, where I spent my time hacking around with everything fun from <b>large-language models</b> to{" "}
          <b>embedded microcontrollers</b>. I like programming in Rust, OCaml, C++, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've worked as a Summer Research Intern @ <b>UCSC (Go Slugs!)</b> and as a lab member at <a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/"><u> Tech4Good</u></a> for over a year. 
          I was also fortunate enough to work with <a href = "https://kcsrk.info/"><u>Prof. KC Sivaramakrishnan</u></a> at <b>Indian Institute Of Technology, Madras</b> on <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml"> <u>Hardcaml</u></a>, Jane Street's embedded DSL for designing and testing hardware designs.
          Over the years, I‚Äôve become deeply entrenched in the world of{" "}

            <div className = " text-center"> <b> Here's a quick TL;DR of me : </b></div>
            <br />
            
            ‚Ä¢ I have an extreme bias for rapid prototyping and building quality software fast. I'm also hyper-optimistic when it comes to solving challenges and energetic when it comes to my work.
            <br />
            <br />
 
            ‚Ä¢ I enjoy cultivating deep technical competence, seek feedback constantly, and always am on the lookout to expand my skills. I also know what I don't know, and am not afraid to reach out for help.
            <br />
            <br />
 
            ‚Ä¢ I learn relatively quickly, can hit the ground running, and love debugging complex codebases. I have genuine passion for delivering outstanding results.
            <br />
            <br />
 
            ‚Ä¢ I'm a niche subset of T-shaped developer, and my operating principles were heavily inspired by <a href = "https://cdn.fastly.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf"> <u>Valve's Employee Handbook</u> </a>
            and the blogs of <a href ="https://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html"> <u>Paul Graham</u> </a> and <a href = "https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> <u>Joel Spolsky</u></a>. 

            <br />
            <br />
          
            <div className = "text-center"><b> I also want to be honest here, so you have the full picture </b></div>
            <br />

            ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm an international student on an F-1 visa and will require future sponsorship (H-1B). I take time to deeply understand problems,
            learn the right tools, explore different solutions, and develop a strong grasp of the codebase.

            <br />
            <br />

            ‚Ä¢ Due to my ADHD, I thrive best in environments where I‚Äôm given autonomy rather than being micromanaged, and I also need a healthy level of mentorship to stay on track and grow meaningfully.
            <br />
            <br />
            ‚Ä¢ I tend to ask tons of questions and am a slow learner by nature.
            While it may take me a little longer than average to fully settle in, this allows me to maximize my long-term growth and impact. I like to build
            what‚Äôs often called ‚Äútribal knowledge‚Äù, so I can contribute effectively and help team members quickly.

          <br />
          <br />
          ‚Ä¢ In the past, I pushed myself too hard and working extremely long hours are no longer sustainable.
          That said, I‚Äôm more than committed and resilient enough to put in the hours needed when things get tough, which they always do. 

          <br />
          <br />
          Now that you know pretty much everything about me as your future team-mate and friend, we could build meaningful connection around our shared love
          for computers and building products people love :)

      <p>
        I enjoy building <b>novel systems</b> and {" "}
        <b>reliable tools</b> that work seamlessly and stand the test of
        time. This was inspired by using and exploring the design of beautiful software 
        such as <b>Vim/Emacs</b>, <b>Ripgrep</b>, <b>Fish shell</b>, <b>Linear</b>, <b>SQLite</b>,
        <b> Signal</b>, <b>Graphviz</b>, <b>Blender</b>, <b>Linux Mint</b>, and many more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiences have taught me to prioritize <b>ownership, autonomy, </b> and{" "}
        align myself with a  <b>strong sense of mission</b> over my work. My process for building 
        cutting-edge systems is through rigorous engineering with creative exploration.
        I strive to write simple and clean code that is incredibly well-tested, approachable,
        and thoughtful.
        <br />
        <br />

        I deeply care about my craft and often discuss various programming topics with

        Here are some of my professional interests in greater detail:
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold pt-4 text-center">
        ‚ú¶ Writing custom GPU kernels & machine learning performance engineering ‚ú¶
      </h4>
      I‚Äôve always had a deep fascination with GPUs ever since I played Crysis 3
      as a kid. Today, I explore ways of writing my own high-performance 
      CUDA kernels for TPUs, GPUs & AWS Trainium. I'd like to study the
      performance characteristics of various GPU architectures and 
      optimize compilers to leverage their hardware features like tensor cores.

      <h4 className="font-semibold pt-4 text-center">
        ‚ú¶ Supercomputing-scale compute & databases for fun and profit{" "} ‚ú¶
      </h4>
      One of my primary interests lies in designing and building novel,
      high-performance systems for machine learning, particularly at
      supercomputing scale. As a humble systems engineer, I'd kill to work on
      interesting projects like optimizing container runtimes, implementing
      distributed file systems, and building query engines like Apache DataFusion.
      <br />
      I love exploring operating system design and HPC network architectures,
      hacking high performance storage systems like Weka and Ceph, 
      designing custom load-balancing algorithms to optimize serving efficiency,
      breaking the CUDA compiler, and enhancing virtual machines performance.

      <h4 className="font-semibold pt-4 text-center">
        ‚ú¶ Building scalable, fault-tolerant Infrastructure for LLM research ‚ú¶
      </h4>
      I take great pleasure in deploying on bare-metal machines and building
      tooling for infrastructure engineers. As a proud supporter of self-host
      movement, I would like to use any opportunity to learn linux virtualization, private networking, and
      cloud-native observability tools, especially pursuing experimental ventures like
      integrating WebAssembly to avoid long cold starts and over-provisioning.
      <br />
      I'm especially interested in delving one level deeper using tools like eBPF to monitor
      and mitigate excessive CPU usage, instrumenting the Linux scheduler with
      ftrace and perfetto, analyzing request latency using sampling profilers
      like gprof, trying <s>failing</s>  to configure Kubernetes for optimal
      workload performance, using pprof to optimize Go code, & add more spells under my sleeve.
      <h4 className="font-semibold pt-4 text-center">
        ‚ú¶ Hacking hardware architectures & high-performance, low-latency applications ‚ú¶
      </h4>
      Building robust low-latency hardware and applications to serve billions of
      users has always been on my career bucket list. I would actually love to put
      my EE degree to use, particularly in FPGA engineering with OCaml,
      chip floorplanning with deep reinforcement learning, and microprocessor architecture design.
      I'd like to build machine learning accelerators such as Google‚Äôs TPU and Groq's LPU, and
      consumer hardware like Apple's AirTag.
      <br />
      Above the hardware stack, I am interested in debugging kernel-level network latency spikes in containers,
      tuning garbage collectors, developing task schedulers, and implementing low-latency,
      high-throughput sampling for large language models. Other strong interests
      include orchestration engines, block storage systems, and compute services.
