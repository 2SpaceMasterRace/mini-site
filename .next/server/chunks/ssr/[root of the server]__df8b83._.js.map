I'm always open to discussing career plans,\n        startup ideas, or even research interests. Feel free to get in touch for\n        a coffee chat through the contacts below. I particularly encourage\n        students from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds who aspire to break into systems\n        to connect with me. I'll be happy to chat and help in any way I can ^-^ \n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;AAGA,SAAS;IACP,qBACE,8OAAC;QAAG,WAAU;;0BACZ,8OAAC;gBAAK,WAAU;0BAAU;;;;;;0BAC1B,8OAAC;gBAAK,eAAY;gBAAO,WAAU;;kCACjC,8OAAC;wBAAK,WAAU;kCACb,yBAAyB,KAAK,CAAC,IAAI,GAAG,CAAC,CAAC,QAAQ,sBAC/C,8OAAC;gCAEC,WAAU;gCACV,OAAO;oCAAE,iBAAiB,CAAC,EAAE,QAAQ,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC;gCAAC;0CAE3C,WAAW,MAAM,WAAW;+BAJxB;;;;;;;;;;kCAQX,8OAAC;wBAAK,WAAU;kCACb,kCAAkC,KAAK,CAAC,IAAI,GAAG,CAAC,CAAC,QAAQ,sBACxD,8OAAC;gCAEC,WAAU;gCACV,OAAO;oCAAE,iBAAiB,CAAC,EAAE,QAAQ,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC;gCAAC;0CAE7C,WAAW,MAAM,WAAW;+BAJtB;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAWnB;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE;;0BACE,8OAAC;;;;;0BACD,8OAAC;gBAAI,WAAU;;kCACb,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACsB,8OAAC;0CAAG;;;;;;4BAAgB;0CAEe,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAuB;0CACI,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAyB;4BAAI;0CACxH,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAA6B;;;;;;;kCAElC,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACwC,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAoB;0CAAwB,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAK;0CAAkC;;;;;;4BAAe;0CACxG,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAsB;;;;;;4BAA+B;0CAAI,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAA0C;0CAAI,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAK;0CAAyC;;;;;;4BAAa;4BAC7J;0CAC9D,8OAAC;;oCAAE;oCACsG;;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAG3G,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACU,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAkD,cAAA,8OAAC;8CAAE;;;;;;;;;;;4BAAoC;0CAG1E,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAqC;;;;;;4BAAY;0CACzE,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAwC;;;;;;4BAAW;0CAAC,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAqC;;;;;;4BAAY;0CAC1I,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAqD;;;;;;4BAAY;4BAC9B;4BAAI;0CAAC,8OAAC;0CAAO;;;;;;4BAC/C;;;;;;;kCAGlB,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAIK,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAO;0CAAkD;;;;;;4BAAQ;;;;;;;kCAG5E,8OAAC;wBAAG,WAAU;kCAAqB;;;;;;kCACnC,8OAAC;wBAAI,WAAU;kCACb,cAAA,8OAAC;;gCAAE;8CACkB,8OAAC;8CAAE;;;;;;gCAAmD;8CAAS,8OAAC;;;;;8CACnF,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAEL,8OAAC;oCAAE,MAAO;8CAAwB;;;;;;gCAA8B;8CAIjE,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;oCAAI,WAAY;;wCAAe;sDAAC,8OAAC;sDAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;8CACpC,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAGN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAGN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAGN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAE2F,8OAAC;oCAAE,MAAO;8CAA8E;;;;;;gCAA+B;8CACvM,8OAAC;oCAAE,MAAM;8CAAsC;;;;;;gCAAiB;8CAAK,8OAAC;oCAAE,MAAO;8CAA2E;;;;;;gCAAiB;8CAE5L,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;8CAED,8OAAC;oCAAI,WAAY;8CAAc,cAAA,8OAAC;kDAAE;;;;;;;;;;;8CAClC,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAKN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAGN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAKR,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;8CAIN,8OAAC;;;;;8CACD,8OAAC;;;;;gCAAK;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAMT,8OAAC;;0CACE,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAc;0CAA2B,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAkC;0CAA2B,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAwB;0CAChH,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAe;0CACzC,8OAAC;;;;;0CACD,8OAAC;;;;;0CACD,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAW;0CAA2B,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAsB;0CAAiB,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAAyC;0CACvF,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;4BAA8B;4BAA0C;;;;;;;kCAGrH,8OAAC;wBAAG,WAAU;kCAAqB;;;;;;kCACnC,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAKH,8OAAC;wBAAG,WAAU;;0CACZ,8OAAC;;kDACC,8OAAC;kDAAE;;;;;;oCAAY;kDAAiB,8OAAC;wCAAE,MAAO;kDAAmD;;;;;;oCAAU;;;;;;;0CAMzG,8OAAC;;kDACC,8OAAC;kDAAE;;;;;;oCAAW;;;;;;;0CAIhB,8OAAC;;kDACC,8OAAC;kDAAE;;;;;;oCAAa;;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAMpB,8OAAC;;0CACC,8OAAC;0CAAO;;;;;;4BAAyB;;;;;;;;;;;;;0BASrC,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAAqB;;;;;;0BACnC,8OAAC;;oBAAE;kCACgB,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAiB;oBAAM;kCAC3C,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAkB;kCAEb,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAa;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAW;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAc;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAU;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAU;kCACzF,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAW;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAY;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAW;kCAAE,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAc;;;;;;;0BAEpE,8OAAC;;oBAAE;kCAC2C,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAAyB;oBAAK;oBAAI;kCAC5D,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;oBAA2B;kCAInD,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;oBAGyE;kCAChF,8OAAC;wBAAE,MAAO;kCAA0B,cAAA,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;oBAAmB;kCAC1D,8OAAC;wBAAE,MAAO;kCAA8C,cAAA,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;oBAAuD;kCACjH,8OAAC;wBAAE,MAAO;kCAA2D,cAAA,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;oBAAuB;kCACtF,8OAAC;wBAAE,MAAO;kCAA8C;;;;;;oBAAY;kCAAI,8OAAC;wBAAE,MAAK;;4BAA+C;0CAAC,8OAAC;0CAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;oBAA8B;;;;;;;0BAI5K,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAAiC;;;;;;YAE1C;0BAOL,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;;oBAAiC;oBACiB;oBAAI;;;;;;;YAC/D;0BAML,8OAAC;;;;;YAAK;0BAMN,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAAiC;;;;;;YAE1C;0BAML,8OAAC;;;;;YAAK;0BAIa,8OAAC;0BAAE;;;;;;YAAW;0BAEjC,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;;oBAAiC;oBACc;oBAAI;;;;;;;YAC5D;0BAOL,8OAAC;;;;;YAAK;0BAMN,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAAqB;;;;;;0BACnC,8OAAC;;kCACC,8OAAC;kCACC,cAAA,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;kCAEL,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;0BAEL,8OAAC;;kCACC,8OAAC;kCAAO;;;;;;oBAAiC;;;;;;;;;AASjD"}},
