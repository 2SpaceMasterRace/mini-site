Outside of my career you can find me spending all my time with my beautiful wife.\n          I like watching films/tv-shows/anime/random-youtube-essays/podcasts, reading manga and literature, playing video-games, learning new languages and train wrestling / muay-thai.\n          Lately I've been trying to get good at artisinal cooking, finance and math/lingustic/informatics olympiads. \n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"font-semibold pt-4\">Current</h2>\n        <div className=\"bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-gray-700 p-4 my-4\">\n          <p>\n            🚨 I am looking for <b>summer-2026 internships / software engineering</b> roles 🚨 <br />\n            <br />\n            I am open to dropping out of my masters program if our interests co-incide and your work is super interesting.\n            If you'd like an old-school dedicated, hardworking & passionate hacker on your team, \n            please reach out to any of my contacts found in the bottom of this website. <br />\n            <br /> \n\n\n            I'm an international student on F-1 visa & I will need sponsorship (H1-B), but please still get in touch with me if you think you'd like to add \n            some personality to your team ( promise to still make huge impacts to your mission :) ).

I deeply care about my craft and tend to\n        have healthy debates over various programming topics, especially with\n        senior engineers. My engineering philosophy is heavily inspired by{\" \"}\n        <b>Andrew Kelley's Practical Data Oriented Design</b> with some elements\n        of Procedural and Functional programming sprinkled in. Here are some of\n        my professional interests in greater detail:\n      </p>\n      <h4 className=\"font-semibold pt-4\">\n        ✦ Supercomputers, Distributed Computing & Systems for Fun and Profit{\" \"}\n      </h4>\n      One of my primary interests lies in designing and building novel,\n      high-performance systems for machine learning, particularly at\n      supercomputing scale. As a humble systems engineer, I'd kill to work on\n      interesting projects like optimizing container runtimes, implementing\n      distributed file systems, and building large-scale data processing\n      applications like Apache Hadoop.\n      <br />\n      Previous experience include exploring operating system design and HPC\n      network architectures, hacking high performance storage systems such as\n      Weka and Ceph, designing custom load-balancing algorithm to optimize\n      serving efficiency, breaking the CUDA compiler, and performance enhancing\n      virtual machines.\n      <h4 className=\"font-semibold pt-4\">\n        ✦ Writing Custom GPU Kernels for Machine Learning Systems{\" \"}\n      </h4>\n      I’ve always had a deep fascination with GPUs ever since I played Crysis 3\n      as a kid. Now, I explore ways of writing my own high-performance GPU/CPU\n      compute kernels for fun and that led me down a rabbit hole of optimizing\n      CUDA kernels for TPUs, GPUs & AWS Trainium. I'd like to see how far I can\n      push modern-day GPUs by studying the performance characteristics of\n      various GPU architectures and optimizing compilers to leverage their\n      hardware features like tensor cores.\n      <h4 className=\"font-semibold pt-4\">\n        ✦ Managing Infrastructure and Handling SEV-1 for Breakfast\n      </h4>\n      I take great pleasure in deploying on bare-metal machines and building\n      tooling for infrastructure engineers. As a proud supporter of self-host\n      movement, I have spent a good amount of time on private networking and\n      cloud-native observability tools. I like being experimental with my work -\n      e.g. integrating WebAssembly to avoid long cold starts and\n      over-provisioning.\n      <br />\n      I'm not afraid to delve one level deeper using tools like eBPF to monitor\n      and mitigate excessive CPU usage, instrumenting the Linux scheduler with\n      ftrace and perfetto, analyzing request latency using sampling profilers\n      like gprof, trying and failing to configure Kubernetes for optimal\n      workload performance, using pprof to optimize Go code & maintain top\n      performance across services and more spells under my sleeve.\n      <h4 className=\"font-semibold pt-4\">\n        ✦ Hacking Hardware Architectures & Performance Engineering{\" \"}\n      </h4>\n      Building robust, low-latency hardware & applications to serve billions of\n      users has always been a career goal of mine. I would actually love to put\n      my EE degree in use particularly on ASIC chip design and developing\n      microprocessor architecture. I'd seize any opportunity on tearing down ML\n      accelerators such as Google’s TPU & Groq's LPU and consumer hardware like\n      Apple's AirTag. <br />I also have a good amount of battle scars in\n      performance and backend engineering, especially in debugging kernel-level\n      network latency spikes in containers, tuning JVM Garbage collection &\n      developing GPU Task Schedulers, and implementing low-latency\n      high-throughput sampling for large language models. Other strong interests\n      include orchestration engines, block storage systems and compute services.\n\n      <h2 className=\"font-semibold pt-8\">Connect</h2>\n      <center>\n        <blockquote>\n          <i>“ It takes a village to raise a child ”</i>\n        </blockquote>\n        <i> - African Proverb</i>\n      </center>\n      <p>\n        Giving back to the community and{\" \"}\n        <strong>paying kindness forward </strong> are important virtues I try to\n        prioritize and practice.
